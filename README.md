Pnut.io Support for Known
==========================

This plugin provides pnut.io syndication (POSSE) support for Known articles and status updates.

It provides basic status update and post syndication from your known site; currently more advanced features (file uploads, starring etc) are not supported. Syndication links back from pnut and links to your pnut post from Known are both working.

Pull requests welcome!
